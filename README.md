<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is part of the selection process for the PHP developer position at [TurnoverBnB](https://turnoverbnb.com/). The proposed challenge can be found [here](https://github.com/TidyDaily/tbnb-test). For this challenge, I tried to keep the code as cleaner and smaller as possible without giving up on organization and separation of concerns. The time I had available was short, so I decided to build a SPA (single page application). Hope you can find this project useful. Please feel free to contact me any time with any questions about it.

### Built With

This project is built with the following tools/frameworks

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [Vue.Js](https://https://vuejs.org/)
* [Laravel](https://laravel.com)
* [MySql](https://mysql.com)


### Usage

To try this project live please access: [Live](http://hil.dev.br/turnoverbnb)

### What's missing

At this project, unfortunatly I wasn't able to implement the *bulk update feature* given the short time I had available. The good news is that this feature is already implemented at the backend, with tests coverage included, leaving only front-end missing. 

### Improvements

As long this is a test project, I'll probably not take this forward, but if I would, these are some improvements I'd like to work on: 

* Front-end Tests coverage
* Docker-compose deploy structure
* Exception treatment to a more user-friendly set of messages and feedbacks at API.
* Improve UX
* Implement bulk update in front-end
